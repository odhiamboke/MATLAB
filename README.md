Breakdown Voltage vs. Impurity Concentration
Overview
This MATLAB script calculates and visualizes the breakdown voltage (V<sub>BR</sub>) as a function of impurity concentration (n<sub>b</sub>) for two semiconductor materials: germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si). Understanding the relationship between impurity concentration and breakdown voltage is crucial for designing reliable electronic devices.

Key Features
Customizable Constants: The script allows you to set the constants (k_1) and (k_2) for Ge and Si, respectively.
Semilogarithmic Plot: The breakdown voltage is plotted on a semilogarithmic scale, providing clear insights into the behavior of V<sub>BR</sub> with changing impurity concentration.
Material-Specific Information: The script highlights the differences between Ge and Si by labeling the plot accordingly.
Usage
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
Run the Script: Open MATLAB and execute the script by typing its name in the command window.
Explore the Plot: The resulting plot will display the breakdown voltage curves for Ge and Si. Adjust the x-axis limits to explore different concentration ranges.
