# Breakdown Voltage Analyzer 🌩️

Dive into the electrifying world of semiconductor physics with this MATLAB script that plots the breakdown voltage against impurity concentration for Germanium (Ge) and Silicon (Si).

## Features ⚡

- **Logarithmic Scaling**: Experience the power of `logspace` to handle wide-ranging values of impurity concentrations.
- **Customizable Plotting**: Tailor your plot with MATLAB's powerful graphical functions.
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for students and professionals looking to understand the relationship between impurity concentration and breakdown voltage in semiconductors.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open the script in MATLAB.
4. Run the script and observe the generated plot.

## Usage 📊

The script calculates the breakdown voltage for a range of impurity concentrations for Ge and Si. It uses the following equations:

- For Ge: $$ V_{br1} = k1 \times \left( \frac{nb}{1.0e16} \right)^{-0.75} $$
- For Si: $$ V_{br2} = k2 \times \left( \frac{nb}{1.0e16} \right)^{-0.75} $$

Where `k1` and `k2` are material constants, and `nb` is the impurity concentration.
